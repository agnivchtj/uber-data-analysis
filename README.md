# Uber Data Analysis Project

Uber is a popular American tech company known for ride-hailing, food delivery, package delivery, couriers, freight transportation, electric bicycle and motorized scooter rental via partnership with Lime. Uber does not own any vehicles but takes a commission from every booking on its platform. Fares, which are priced using a dynamic model based on local supply and demand at the time of booking, are quoted to the customer in advance.

As of the fourth quarter of 2021, Uber had 118 million monthly active users worldwide and generated an average of 19 million trips per day. We will be analyzing data pertaining to Uber trips in order to produce key insights and/or processing (using Python) that can be useful for analysts in understanding traffic, pricing fares etc.
